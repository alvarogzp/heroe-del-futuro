# Héroe del futuro
_Héroe del futuro_ is a small J2ME game, which was developed during the summer of 2009.
Created by me (as the programmer) and a friend (as the artist).
It was my first contact with a _real_ programming language.

This branch contains the website of the game. You can access it at https://alvarogzp.github.io/heroe-del-futuro.

It was originally reachable at heroedelfuturo.webs.com (currently down),
and hosted at http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/HeroeDelFuturo/heroedelfuturo/HeroeDelFuturo.html (at the time of writing this, still up).

Minor modifications were made from the original version to convert all URLs to https, update youtube embed code and reencode html files in UTF-8.
